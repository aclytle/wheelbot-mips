This project contains code for a bluetooth controlled, semi-autonomous robot. Originally implemented on a Digilent Cerebot MX2 board with a Microchip PIC32. 

The robot can be remotely controlled over UART or bluetooth, with the proper hardware. Also supports a character display, for debugging and typing messages to people observing the robot.

Once a control interface is established, the controls are as follows:
	w - forward full speed
	s - stop
	q - increment motor 1 speed
	e - increment motor 2 speed
	a - decrement motor 1 speed
	d - decrement motor 2 speed
	z - reverse motor 1 direction
	c - reverse motor 2 direction
	u - circle pattern
	i - square pattern
	o - figure 8 pattern
	p - triangle pattern
	l - line following mode

Required hardware:
	PIC32 Microcontroller development board
	H-Bridge module/modules (for driving 2 motors)
	2 motors
	Robot Chassis and parts (wheels, tires, hardware, etc.)

Optional hardware:
	Bluetooth UART module
	LCD Character display screen
	UART interface

Port mapping should be changed based on your specific microcontroller and dev board.
